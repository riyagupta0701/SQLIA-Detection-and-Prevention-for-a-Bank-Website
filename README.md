# SQLIA-Detection-and-Prevention-for-a-Bank-Website

SQL injection attacks are SQL queries that are injected or inserted, usually into the login fields of a website.
Being a valid query, this allows the hackers to spoof their identity and access unauthorized information.

However, SQL injection attacks can be easily prevented by detection and prevention techniques if thought about right from the initial design and development phase.
Techniques implemented in this code:
Detection: Input Type Checking, Pattern Matching
Prevention: Input Validation, Parameterized Queries, Escaping
